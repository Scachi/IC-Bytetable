# IC-Bytetable
IC-Bytetable - GPC2 (Titan Two) Script Helper Tool for interactive configurations

This tool helps Titan Two script creators:
- to keep track of the used pmem byteoffsets of their GUI
- spot free space easily
- error checking like overlapping memory space and more. 

It does parse a gpc script from file or clipboard, searching for Interactive Configuration declaration, showing the result in a table.
